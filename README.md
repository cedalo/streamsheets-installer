# streamsheets-installer
A repo with an installer for RaspberryPi-Streamsheets


# Raspberry Pi (Buster/Stretch)
start the pi-installer.sh script on your Pi
(example: "curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/cedalo/streamsheets-installer/master/pi-installer.sh -o get-streamsheets.sh && sh get-streamsheets.sh")

This Script works on both Raspbian Stretch and Buster now. If you use an older Version of Raspbian (like Jessie or wheezy), you shall be able to install docker and docker-compose using your 2 years of experience ;-D
