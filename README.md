# streamsheets-installer
A repo with an installer for RaspberryPi-Streamsheets


# Raspberry Pi (Buster/Stretch)
start the pi-installer.sh script on your Pi
(example: "curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/cedalo/streamsheets-installer/master/pi-installer.sh -o get-streamsheets.sh && sh get-streamsheets.sh")

This Script works on both Raspbian Stretch and Buster now. If you use an older Version of Raspbian, you shall be able to install docker and docker-compose using your 2 years of experience ;-D
