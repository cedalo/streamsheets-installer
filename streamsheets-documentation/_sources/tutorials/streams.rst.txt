Working with Streams
=========================
Streams build the link to the outside wolrd for any data stream you want to build. Architectural we are working with Connectors, Consumern and Producern.

Connector

A Connector is always the foundation of our communication architecture. Consumer and Producer reference to a Connector and define the details. The connector itself "connects" the Stream Sheet to a provider you can easily choose from a preconfigured list. Once a provider is choosen, there are a variety of settings, which can be applied to define the details of your data stream.

MQTT Connector
``````````````
The MQTT Connector has the following possible settings.

|CSettings|

+ **Name:** The Name of your Connector
+ **Provider:** you canÂ´t change the provider. You choose it while creating the connector.
+ **URL:** Choose the MQTT Broke you want to use. If you want to use our own broker, which is hosted by the Stream Sheet Server, type in ``broker``
+ **Port:** Choose the port you will be using to transfer the data.
+ **User Name & Password:** If your URL needs identification, you can type in your credentials. For local usage not neccessary.
+ **Base Topic:** The Base topic describes where the connector will be connected to.
+ **Retain Message:**
+ **QoS:** Stands for quality of service. You have the choice between: At most once, At least once, Exactly once.
+ **Label:** Choose a label to categorize the Connector and to possibly administer usage rights over our Label system.

Producer

A Producer is used in a Function. It directs the data stream out of the Stream Sheet. The Function together with the Producer defines where your data will be heading. A Producer is always connected to a Connector, which serves as the foundation of a Producer.
Once the Connector is choosen, there are some additional settings within the Producer.

MQTT Producer
`````````````
The MQTT Producer has the following possible settings:

|PSettings|

+ **Name:** The Name of your Producer.
+ **Connector:** Choose the connected Connector.
+ **Data Format:** Choose the Data Format a Producer will publish the Messages in.
+ **Topic:** Extend the Base Topic of the Connector. The Message will be sent to the full topic branch defined through Connector, Producer and Function (ConnectorTopic/ProducerTopic/FunctionTopic).
+ **Label:** Choose a label to categorize the Connector and to possibly administer usage rights over our Label system.

Consumer
--------

A Consumer is always connected to the Inbox of a Stream Sheet. It defines the details of the data stream comming into a Stream Sheet. A Consumer is always connected to a Connector. Once the Connector is choosen, there are some additional settings within the Consumer.


MQTT Consumer
`````````````
The MQTT Consumer has the following Settings:

|ConSettings|

+ **Name:** The Name of your Consumer.
+ **Connector:** Choose the connected Connector.
+ **Data Format:** Choose the Data Format you wish to accept in the Inbox.
+ **Client ID:**
+ **Topics:** Choose one or more topics the Consumer will listen to. Use the comma "," to seperate topics from another. The topics always extend the Connector Base Topic.
+ **Filter:**
+ **Label Attribute:**
+ **ID Attribute:**
+ **Label:** Choose a label to categorize the Connector and to possibly administer usage rights over our Label system.
