Installing on a Raspberry Pi
============

Setting up Docker
-----------

1. To run Streamsheets you need Docker 18.09 or higher. To set up Docker on a Raspberry Pi, use the following command:

    ``curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh``

2. Check the installation by running the following command:

    ``docker -v``

Setting up Docker Compose
-----------

1. To install Docker Compose on a Raspberry Pi, run the following commands:

    | ``sudo apt-get update``
    | ``sudo apt-get install -y python python-pip``
    | ``sudo pip install docker-compose``

2. Check the installation by running the following command:

    ``docker-compose -v``

Setting up Streamsheets
-----------

.. hint:: Please also replace < and > !    e.g. step 1: ``mkdir <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>`` â†’ ``mkdir Streamsheets``

1. In order to install Streamsheets first create a target folder for the installation. Choose between manually add the folder or just navigate to your prefered dircetory in your shell and use:

    ``mkdir <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>``

2. Next run the following command to execute the installer for Streamsheets. Replace ``<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>`` with the name of the installation directory and ``<VERSION>`` with the Streamsheets version to install (current version: \ :ref:`currently`\ ).

    ``docker run -v $(pwd)/<INSTALL_DIRECTORY>:/streamsheets cedalo/streamsheets-installer:<VERSION>-rpi``

3. Navigate into the following directory:

    ``cd <INSTALL_DIRECTORY>/streamsheets/scripts/``

This directory contains several shell scripts (and Docker Compose files) to run predefined configiurations of Streamsheets. 

Starting Streamsheets
-----------

To start the default configuration, run the following command:

``sh start.sh``

The web interface for Streamsheets is available under: ``http://<RASPBERRY_PI_IP>:8081/`` (replace ``<RASPBERRY_PI_IP>`` by either the IP address or the hostname of the Raspberry Pi).
