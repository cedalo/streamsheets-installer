Welcome to the Streamsheet Application Help
=============================================

Streamsheets are a new spreadsheet technology specifically designed for the challenges and opportunities of
digitization and the Industrial IoT.

With Streamsheets you make your data immediately understandable and create IoT applications visually and
interactively - without a single line of code. This way also end-user are empowered to model individual solutions
and company-specific process logics.

They serve as an orchestration tool to connect digital "things" ranging from sensors to enterprise software, apps
and websites, to direct data streams and to define both simple as well as very complex process logics.

This help serves initially as a tutorial to guide you through the first steps to define and use Streamsheets and to
get an understanding, what you can do with Streamsheets and how you do it. This help is also intended as a reference
to explain the different aspects and features of the application in detail. It supports you during the development
of Streamsheets by providing specific information for the tasks, that need to be accomplished.

If you are new to Streamsheets, you should start with the :doc:`introduction` guide to get a quick overview of
the core concept. Once this is clear, we provide tutorials for the most common tasks in defining a Streamsheet process.
